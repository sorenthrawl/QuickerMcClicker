# QuickerMcClicker

Author: Soren Thrawl

To run execute:
    javac *.java
    java quickerMcClicker

I so far have a square print on the screen that when pressed turns off. I also have a button that adds new squares. I will be making it so that when a square is pressed a new square will pop up. I also want to make the button only change the square placement and will restart the timer. I will be adding a timer that times how long you take to push a set number of squares.
